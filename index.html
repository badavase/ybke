				<h2>YBKE Summary</h2>
				<p>
					YBKE is one of the oldest active groupchats which came from Covid,
					what started as passing the time two years ago was consolidated in a
					group in which people inside it talk everyday, that's how it is and
					that's how it will be in the future. <br />
					But what makes this group special?
				</p>
				<ul id="html-list">
					<li>
						Two years of its creation makes the members of this group relations
						strong
					</li>
					<li>Variety of characters</li>
					<li>Group renewal with new members every one to three months</li>
					<li>
						The kindness of the members to help eachother and talk to eachother
						in a respectful manner
					</li>
					<li>
						The irony, the jokes, or to put it more briefly, the energy that
						radiates from the group.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
